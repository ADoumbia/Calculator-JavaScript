# Calculator-JavaScript
My first exploration with Web Development, a web page that runs a simple calculator in order to understand the fundamentals of Web Development using languages including HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.

Update - 2020/24/05: Converted the calculator into a Scientific calculator. Extended functionality by including Trigonometric functions, Exponential function, square root function, pi, and the natural logorithm.
